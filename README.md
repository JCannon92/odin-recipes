A repo for The Odin Project foundational course.

This repo will be used to practice and demonstrate my basic HTML skills, following The Odin
Project. I am already reasonably experienced with HTML, and would consider myself an intermediate
level learner. However, I have already learnt a few new things from the course, which is great.
