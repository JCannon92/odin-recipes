    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Does the combination of tender potatoes, carmalised onions and sikly eggs sounds delicious to you? If so, you should cook this recipe because it tastes really good. Also it's quite cheap.</p>
    <p>By the way I got this image from a free website and it's probably AI, your Spanish Omelette won't look exactly like that.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 Large potatoes sliced to 5-10mm discs</li>
        <li>3 Large White or Brown onions slice to 5-10mm rings</li>
        <li>8 Eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>Vast quantities of good quality extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1.5 to 2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>A good grind of black pepper</li>        
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large frying pan on medium heat.</li>
        <li>When oil is hot, layer in potato discs and onion rings in an alternating fashion, adding the salt and pepper as you go.</li>
        <li>Cook for approximately 20 mins covering with a lid, plate or wooden chopping board, until potato is tender but not mushy.</li>
        <li>Drain some of the olive oil from the frying pan into a bowl.</li>
        <li>Add beaten eggs to frying pan, pricking the potatoes and onions with a fork to allow the eggs to permeate into the centre of the omelette.</li>
        <li>Preheat grill.</li>
        <li>Cook uncovered on low-medium heat until eggs are just starting to set.</li>
        <li>Place frying pan uncovered under grill to brown the top of the omlette. Do not burn.</li>
        <li>When top of omelette is gently browned and eggs are just set, remove from grill and serve.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Note that it is up to you how well cooked you would like the omelette, if you like the eggs soft and silky then cook for less time, if you like the eggs fully cooked and firm then cook under grill for longer.</p>
