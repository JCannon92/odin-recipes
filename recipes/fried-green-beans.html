    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a fanstastic side for the Spanish Omlette recipe. Fried green beans low and slow in a beautiful rich tomato and shallot olive oil blend.</p>
    <p>By the way I stole this recipe from the Ottolenghi Comfort recipe book, I didn't make it up it's all on them.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Tons of green beans, like enough that the supermarket people look at you and are like what is that person doing with so many green beans, left long</li>
        <li>A large handful of cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
        <li>7-8 Shallots, sliced</li>
        <li>An absurd amount of olive oil</li>
        <li>Like 2 to 3 tbsp of dried oregano</li>
        <li>1.5 tbsp of lemon juice</li>
        <li>Some chilli flakes, if you like it hot</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add olive oil to a large saute pan (with lid) on a medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add all ingredients into in the pan and bring to a medium heat so they're gently frying.</li>
        <li>Stir briskly to make sure everything is nice and mixed up.</li>
        <li>Turn heat slightly down and cover, cooking for 40 minutes until the beans have lost their vibrant colour, but haven't gone too mushy.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat and let the pan cool, the beans should be served gently warm.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
